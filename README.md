# Encrypted-Guessing-Game-Project
A client-server  guessing game enhanced with AES-256-CBC encryption. This implementation secures all network communication by generating a unique IV per session, handling PKCS#7 padding, and using a static key derived from a student ID hash. Designed to demonstrate practical application of symmetric cryptography in network programming.
